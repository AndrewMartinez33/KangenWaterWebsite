            <p>Americans buy 29 billion water bottles a year. For every six bottles people buy, only one is
              recycled. The big problem is that water bottles do not biodegrade, but rather
              photodegrade. This means that it takes at least up to 1,000 years for every single bottle to decompose,
              leaking pollutants into our soil and water along the way.
